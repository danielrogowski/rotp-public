RotP - Tactical Council Votes

Whats this about?
TCV is mod for RotP, changing the behaviour of the base AI concerning council votes. 
AIs will base their decision for an nominee on their relations and the difference in power, according to the AI personalities and based on a fixed score, 
random elements in the decision are removed (except for the erratic Bot type - the gravitas of diplomacy and strength will change from vote to vote for them).

The target of this mod is not to create a human-like AI, but an AI that is
a) satisfying to play against
b) tries to emulate the behavior of a faction that aims to dominate the galaxy but tries to ensure it's own survival if this isn't possible.

Boni for Dominating the Orion and the human diplomacy trait are still considered.

Based on RotP 1.02a
